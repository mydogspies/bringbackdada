        bri+gba*kDADA <span
            class="home_paragraph_small_text">(pron: "bringbackdada")</span> is a photography project by Berlin-based
        visual artist <a href="https://silenceisgrand.com" target="_blank">Silenceisgrand</a> in which he explores the human body through the movement created by the combination of
        lighting and composition. It's an open-ended project with no particular goal but the creative visual journey through
        various milieus and contexts with the body as the central subject.
